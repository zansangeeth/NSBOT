## Android MVVM Architecture

MVVM stands for Model, View, ViewModel.

* [ ] Model: This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to expose the data to the ViewModel through Observables.

* [ ] View: It represents the UI of the application devoid of any Application Logic. It observes the ViewModel.

The following flow illustrates the core MVVM Pattern.
